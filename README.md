Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?

DriverPass is an innovative company aiming to provide users with vital information they can rely on when taking their DMV driving exam. A user-friendly system that includes a user profile, a scheduling system, and both online and real-world driving exams comes together to help their customers.

What did you do particularly well?

I’m proud of how my system design document came together. The multiple diagrams I created clearly show the system's complexity at a high level. 

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

Although I’m proud of my system design document, I would have liked to expand the diagramming further. Creating more specific activity and sequence diagrams for more parts of the whole project.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

DriverPass had various specific needs. The diagramming really helped me focus on what the customer wanted. Visually showing the system's importance helped me translate those critical parts into writing for the rest of the project and for multiple assignments we did throughout the semester.

How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?

Designing is an interesting part of software development; my first instinct is to dive into code writing. But after going through this class, it became clear that taking the time to lay out the details shows that preparation is everything. Having a strong foundation is the best strategy when developing code.
